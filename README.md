# Hi there!

This is a web application, build with React, that helps you keep track of your recipes better.
What's so special about this?

It manages to save everything in the localStorage, which means there is no need to create an account. 

You just have to add some recipes and they'll stay there forever (well, if you don't clear your localStorage at least).

Any improvements and suggestions are welcomed with a kind heart :) I want this app to be of use to people, and I can't wait to make it better.
